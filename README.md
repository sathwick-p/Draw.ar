# ARDraw

The potential of such app is compared to the invention of writing itself. Google is successfully experimenting with such tools (Just a Line and Tilt Brush), but haven’t come up with the universal application yet.

As you might think, AR drawing app opens hundreds of use cases. Here’s just a few of them:

1. Replacement of blackboard/whiteboard.
2. Antivandal street art and graffiti.
3. Digital signs.
4. Advertising.
5. Local signs in AR space.
